## Introduction
algxbra is designed to improve math skills by providing a fun and interactive gaming experience. The game presents arithmetic questions where the player needs to solve for the value of 'x'. The difficulty level can be adjusted, and the player aims to achieve a high score within a time limit.

## Features
- Interactive main menu screen
- Difficulty selection (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Timed gameplay with a countdown timer
- Randomly generated arithmetic questions
- Multiple choice options for each question
- Score tracking and high score persistence
- Game over screen with score display and option to play again or return to the main menu

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- SQLite database support

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Install the Pygame library using pip:

`pip install pygame`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to start the game:

`python3 main.py`

4. The game will launch, and you will see the main menu screen. Use the mouse to navigate and click on the options.

5. In the main menu, you can select the difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) by clicking on the respective option.

6. Once the game starts, a math question will be displayed, and you need to select the correct answer from the multiple-choice options.

7. The game has a time limit, and you must answer as many questions as possible within the given time.

8. After the time runs out, the game over screen will be displayed, showing your score and the current high score. You can choose to play again or return to the main menu.
